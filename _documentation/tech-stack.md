## SASS

Styling is powered with Sass, a preprocessor scripting language that is interpreted or compiled into Cascading Style Sheets (CSS).

### Compiler file

All scss files are imported into the `app.scss` file. This means that when you create a new `.scss` file, you need to add the path to that file to `app.scss`. 

This file then compiles all the files into a single `.css` file, readable by the browser.
